# YETI SB140 29" LR C2 GX BIKE 2024

The LR C2 version of the Yeti SB140 comes with a SRAM GX Eagle 12-speed drivetrain. This includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 10-52T gear range that makes climbing and pedaling through rough terrain much easier. SRAM Code R 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can descend with confidence. Crank Brothers Synthesis Enduro 30mm wheels are paired with Maxxis Minion DHF and DHR II tires that can be set up tubeless for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats. With the OneUp Dropper Post, you'll be able to quickly lift and lower your saddle with the press of a lever.
