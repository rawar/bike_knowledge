# SANTA CRUZ NOMAD 6 C S BIKE

The Nomad 6 C S Bike hits the component sweet spot, with a SRAM GX Eagle drivetrain providing a wide gear range, with crisp and reliable shifting. The Fox 38 Float Performance fork offers stiff, tuneable suspension, paired with a RockShox Super Deluxe Select+ rear shock to soak up big hits. The RaceFace AR Offset 30 rims are laced to the legendary DT Swiss 370 hubs with 36-tooth freehub engagement, for reliable performance. When it comes time to scrub some speed, SRAM Code R brakes provide stopping power, while an SDG Tellis Dropper Post makes it a breeze to maneuver through tricky rock gardens and big drops.
